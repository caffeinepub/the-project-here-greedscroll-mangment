  "summary": "The implementation successfully addresses both requirements by filtering wallets based on non-zero token balances and displaying only relevant wallets in the TokenMetrics component. The changes include helper functions to determine wallet relevance, filtering logic in loadHoldings, and similar filtering for the Layer 2 Trust Lines section.",

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Layer 2 Trust Lines expandable section with wallet-level collapsible functionality",
      "reason": "The implementation adds expandable/collapsible functionality for individual wallets within the Layer 2 Trust Lines section (using expandedWallets state and toggle functions). While the BuildRequest constraints mention preserving the Layer 2 Trust Lines collapsible section functionality, there is no requirement to add or modify wallet-level expand/collapse features within that section.",
